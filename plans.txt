Code has been redesigned and updated from the ground up.
Now, nearly everything is automated.
Even the rating graphs on the graph site are embeds and update automatically.

I am not sure about what I should work on next!

Only things that are still manual are:

1. Copying data from the 4 .csv files onto the sheet.
2. Updating Tournaments won stat on the Sheet.
3. Creating player cards on the site.
4. Adding players on the sheet.
5. Tournament cards/tournament site.
6. Node graph.

Everything else works smooth as butter!
