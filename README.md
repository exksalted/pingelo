# Pingelo

This is a personal project, that stems from my attempt to gather and represent data from the table tennis games of my group.
I gather data from games manually in .txt form. This data is processed by three different .py codes, from which the stats are gathered.
The data is updated into a Google Sheet, which updates most stats on the site.
